# SFML Chess Developed by IlmƒÅrs Kuhtraskis

The game was created with all standard chess rules in mind, just to test my skills in SFML and C++ Software development.

The game includes:
  - En passant
  - Castling
  - Only legal moves (not against chess rules) can be made, this includes:
    - Can't castle to check
    - King can't go into check
    - Pieces can't move if friendly king would be in check
    - King must move out of check or block
  - Pawn Promotion to Queen
  - Legal move highlighting
  
  
  Future goal - AI opponent using Deep learning
  
  There is no checkmate screen, checkmate occurs when a player can't make any legal moves anymore
